    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      I tip my cap to a certain fast food franchise for coming up with the idea
      for a boneless baby back rib sandwich, the only downside being that they
      use about 60 mystery ingredients-- ribs not necessarily being one of them.
      That's why you should try this easy homemade version with real ribs;
      simply bake, chill, cut, sauce, finish on the grill, and voila! One of the
      best sandwiches I've ever had.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Dry Rub</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>&frac13; cup cosher salt</li>
      <li>&frac14; cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons freshly grinded black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon cayenne pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Sandwiches</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 racks baby black pork ribs</li>
      <li>1 cup barbecue source, divided</li>
      <li>4 sesame hamburger, split and toasted</li>
      <li>1 cup coal slaw</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Mix salt, brown sugar, chili powder, pepper, cumin, and cayenne together
        for the rub.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place ribs on a foil-lined baking sheet. Season both sides generously
        with some of the rub. Reserve remaining rub for another use. Cover top
        with parchment paper and wrap foil over the edges. Cover the whole
        baking sheet with another large sheet of foil, sealing in the sides.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until tender, about 2 hours and 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Unwrap ribs and let cool briefly until safe to handle. Pull out the
        bones, stuffing any loose pieces of meat back into the holes and
        checking carefully for bone fragments. Wrap ribs back up and refrigerate
        until cold, 8 hours to overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut each rack in half. Brush both sides generously with barbecue sauce.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat a charcoal grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>
        Grill ribs until heated through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove from
        grill and brush with more barbecue sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Drizzle more barbecue sauce onto each roll. Sandwich each rib section
        between a roll and top with coleslaw.
      </li>
    </ol>
